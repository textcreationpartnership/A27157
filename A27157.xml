            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He ſhortneſse of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Treatiſe admits not long prefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing: It has been much wiſht and long expected from the learned Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines of this Land, that
<pb facs="tcp:50114:3"/>
a plaine and ſhort Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall of the chiefe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies ſhould have been publiſhed, whereby the people might be fore armed againſt the inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſeducing ſpirits which everie where are but too frequent. Long agoe too much ſtuffe of this kind is provided for Scholars, Theſe have but too many and too big Volumes of Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies alwaies at their hand, but our people are
<pb facs="tcp:50114:3"/>
not ſo furniſht either with ſword or buckler as need were, which makes them to their ſhame and griefe, when they run counter with adverſaries (which they cannot chooſe but oft to doe) lie open to wounds: The children of this world are in this as in many other things, wiſer than the children of light: the Ieſuits let not their Proſelites have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny lack of their <hi>Enchei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridia,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:50114:4"/>
their <hi>Vade me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi> their little pocket Books of controverſie to enable them both to ſtrik and keep, when they meet with our people.</p>
            <p>Theſe yeares bygone too much time hath been loſt among us on Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and Diſciplina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Queſtions. It has bin the policy of Satan to hold us intent, and buſy on theſe out-ſconces, that ſo the main fortreſses of Antichriſt ſhould ſtand
<pb facs="tcp:50114:4"/>
ſafe without aſſault. Would to God that our too too long and hot skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes about purging of the ditches of <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> had not caſt open at our backs the gates of our great Towers, and given opportunitie to our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to undermine the verie foundations of our Church. Theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Queſtions, are now we truſt, neare to a bleſſed end; from the
<pb facs="tcp:50114:5"/>
one half of this Iſle, <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi> and <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> are commanded by the King and State, (not the Church only) to goe packing into per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall baniſhment. The like juſtice is ſhortly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected for the reforming of the other halfe: The world knows that <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi> and <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> have bin more trou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bleſome to <hi>England</hi> than to <hi>Scotland,</hi> or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other people in the

Earth. Shall any doubt of the Kings equall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignitie to all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, or of the State of <hi>England,</hi> their wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to be no leſse pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident for the welfare of their Country, than they have lately ſeen their Neighbours, with his <hi>Majeſties</hi> full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, carefull for theirs.</p>
            <p>Being, therefore, we truſt on our farewell to theſe noiſome ſhadows, and all the unluckie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputations
<pb facs="tcp:50114:6"/>
which have followed and ſtill will follow them, where ever they go to dwell, hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wee expect to attend alone upon the ſubſtance both of our Truths and our Enemies Errours.</p>
            <p>Of all the Errours which in too great a num<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ber doe corrupt <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> this day, theſe which are called after the infamous name of <hi>Arminius,</hi> are the moſt prevalent: For to
<pb facs="tcp:50114:6"/>
propagate that <hi>Hereſie</hi> (as King <hi>Iames</hi> was wont boldly to call it,) not only numbers of the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> and other <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Seminaries</hi> doe employ their labours, but the prime <hi>Biſhops,</hi> all the <hi>Clergie,</hi> who had any mind to preferment, have for a long time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted their tongues and pens: and that this evill ſeed might proſper and ſpread, by the calumni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous informations of that
<pb facs="tcp:50114:7"/>
mad Prelate, who now is in a faire way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive quickly ſome part of his deſervings, an Edict was publiſhed diſcharging any to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that peſtilence, or to pluck up that Cockle.</p>
            <p>While therefore the Learned may be pleaſed to demit themſelves for the good of the people, while ſome gracious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine may be moved to take leiſure for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of ſome ſhort
<pb facs="tcp:50114:7"/>
and plain Syſtem of all or of the moſt materiall Controverſies, it were good that ſome little thing were done in this beginning of our glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Liberty from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopall Oppreſsion, for the arming of the godly againſt the errors of <hi>Arminius,</hi> which ſo malepertly theſe bygone yeares have bin blowne abroad, and the oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereto hath beene ſo ſtrictly diſcharged, &amp; ſo ſeverely puniſhed while
<pb facs="tcp:50114:8"/>
a better comes, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent Treatiſe will ſerve ſomewhat for that end; Of its worth let every man pronounce according as hee finds. In its first birth it was a ſpeech delivered upon a ſhort warning in the generall Aſſembly of <hi>Glaſgow, 1638,</hi> and there not miſlik't. Since that time it hath not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed much in ſtature. If the feature of it pleaſe any intelligent eye, it is
<pb facs="tcp:50114:8"/>
eaſie in a few nights for any to make the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of it grow ſo great and long as you will, but it is the Authours opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that treatiſes inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the fore-named ends are the more hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and ſerviceable, the more ſhort and ſimple they be, and the more unprofitable &amp; unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant, the more accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and long: Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſuch as it is enjoy it who will, miſregard it who pleaſe.</p>

two heads therein: Firſt, how far nature can fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grace &amp; ſalvation, next how far it can hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it: In the firſt head ſundry teach that nature alone without grace can ſave, that numbers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the knowledge of Chriſt by their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Law of Nature through the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of right reaſon have been ſaved: Others aſcribe not ſalvation di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to nature alone without grace, yet they make ſaving grace to depend upon nature, ſo that the right uſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:50114:41"/>
doth draw by way of merit, at leaſt by way of infallible dependance the grace of Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Others goe not thus far in <hi>Pelagianiſme,</hi> yet they give too much to nature in the matter of ſalvation, they teach that ſin hath not taken away the power of the underſtanding and of the will of man to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and obey God, but only the exerciſe of that power, that the power of mans Soul to all gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious works is not dead but bound in fetters, far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that in the very firſt
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:50114:41"/>
act of our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>verſion, not only in all poſterior acts of grace, God and Man, Nature and Grace doe concurre as two partiall cauſes, ſo that the whole effect of Converſion doth depend not only from Gods grace, but alſo the whole of it does flow from Man &amp; Nature, yea, that which maketh Grace efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to Converſion and Salvation is not Grace but Nature alone; for the concurrence of Grace is oft (ſay they) alike in theſe who are converted, and thoſe
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:50114:42"/>
who are never conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in theſe who are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and thoſe who are damned, in both they put a degree of grace ſimply equall, ſo that the only difference which caſts the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, the only reaſon, why the ſame degree of grace which is efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to convert and ſave one, yet is not efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for theſe effects in another, is alone in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, even in the free will of the one accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and yielding to that degree of grace, which the free will of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:50114:42"/>
made inefficacious by its own reſiſting and rejection thereof.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond head of natures power to hinder Grace and Salvation, the moſt common and infamous concluſion is, that the free wil of man not only hath power to reject and refuſe, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell and fruſtrate, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome and make of none effect the moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious motions of the regenerating Spirit of God, but alſo very oft does put this power in practice, hindring God
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50114:43"/>
when he intends to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert and ſave, by its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible perverſneſſe to obtaine that his graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous end and mercifull intention.</p>
               <p>The errours of the firſt head the <hi>Arminians</hi> oft in word doe caſt them from themſelves upon the Papiſts, yet in very deed they ſtumble too often upon them all.</p>
               <p>The errours of the ſecond head they deny not to be their Tenets: however for confutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:50114:43"/>
of all errours in both the heads let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme theſe two propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions.</p>
               <p>Firſt, neither free wil, nor any other naturall faculty in man hath any power at all to purchaſe either the beginning or midſt of perfection ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of grace or ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but both grace and glory commeth alone from God that quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens nature, dead in ſin, and makes it to worke not in the ſtrength of it ſelf, but alone of grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:50114:44"/>Secondly, that as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cannot further grace nor ſalvation, ſo can it not hinder the Omnipotent power of the regenerating Spirit of God to call and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert, and ſave whom ever hee hath a purpoſe to call, convert, and ſave. For the full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the firſt propoſition, ſee in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture theſe 3 grounds cleerly ſet downe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Man by his free will is not able for any ſpiritual good.</note>Firſt, That in no man by nature is any power at all to any ſpirituall good.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:50114:44"/>Secondly, That in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man by nature not only is a ſimple impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie to good, but alſo an exceeding great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to all ſpiritual evill.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, What ever power to ſpiritual good, or what ever gracious operation is found in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man, the only cauſe of that good is from God, who works it in man, and makes man to worke in the ſtrength not of humane Nature, but of divine Grace.</p>
